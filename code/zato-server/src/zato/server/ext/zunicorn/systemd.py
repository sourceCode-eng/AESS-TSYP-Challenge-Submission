    Get the number of sockets inherited from systemd socket activation.

    Returns zero immediately if $LISTEN_PID is not set to the current pid.

    $LISTEN_FDS.

    When $LISTEN_PID matches the current pid, unsets the environment variables

        Unlike the sd_listen_fds C function, this implementation does not set
        the FD_CLOEXEC flag because the gunicorn arbiter never needs to do this.
